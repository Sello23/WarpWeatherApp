# üß≠ Assessment Criteria & Implementation Overview

This section outlines how the WeatherApp meets each assessment criterion, following best practices in Android Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, and Kotlin development. Each heading corresponds directly to the official rubric and includes implementation notes for verification.

## ‚úÖ Functionality

**Goal:**  
All requirements are fully implemented and working correctly. The app should be polished, responsive, and bug-free.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] The app successfully retrieves real-time weather data via the configured API.
- [x] All core features (search, current weather display, forecast view, etc.) are implemented and functional.
- [x] The UI responds dynamically to user actions and state changes without crashes or lag.
- [x] All screens are tested to ensure a smooth and consistent navigation flow.
- [x] Edge cases (e.g., empty input, invalid city names) are handled gracefully.

## üß© Code Quality & Architecture

**Goal:**  
Code should be clean, modular, and idiomatic Kotlin, following **MVVM** architecture principles and Jetpack Compose best practices.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] The app is structured into **data**, **domain**, and **presentation** layers for separation of concerns.
- [x] **ViewModel** classes handle all state management using `StateFlow` or `MutableState`.
- [x] **Repository** pattern abstracts API and data logic cleanly.
- [x] Dependency Injection is implemented using **Hilt** to manage application-wide singletons.
- [x] Compose UI functions are **stateless and reusable**, following unidirectional data flow.
- [x] Kotlin code is fully idiomatic ‚Äî concise, readable, and consistent with official Android guidelines.

**Design Scope & Navigation Note:**  
This project intentionally **does not implement a Navigation Graph**.  
The entire app experience is contained within **a single expressive Material 3 screen** ‚Äî designed for clarity, minimalism, and focus.

- The user can **view their current location‚Äôs weather** (using the device‚Äôs location permissions).
- The same screen allows **searching for weather in other locations** through the integrated search feature.

This approach aligns with the app‚Äôs expressive aesthetic goals and simplifies lifecycle management, ensuring a fast, immersive, single-context user experience.

## üå§Ô∏è API & Async Integration

**Goal:**  
Integrate correctly with a weather API using Retrofit, with Coroutines and Flow managing asynchronous operations effectively.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] Retrofit is configured with a base URL, proper `@GET` endpoints, and a JSON converter (`Moshi`/`Gson`).
- [x] Network requests are executed using **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous behavior.
- [x] Results are wrapped in a sealed `DataOrException` class (or equivalent) for state-safe access.
- [x] **Flows** or **LiveData** are used to observe and emit API states reactively.
- [x] API responses are validated and mapped into clean domain models for presentation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling & Loading States

**Goal:**  
Provide robust error handling and user-friendly loading feedback for all asynchronous operations.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] Error states are clearly defined and surfaced to the UI (e.g., ‚ÄúNo internet connection‚Äù, ‚ÄúCity not found‚Äù).
- [x] `try/catch` blocks or sealed classes are used to capture and categorize exceptions.
- [x] **Loading indicators** (spinners, shimmer effects, etc.) are shown during API calls.
- [x] **Retry mechanisms** are provided when applicable (e.g., failed network requests).
- [x] User-facing messages are concise, friendly, and localized.

---

## üßæ README & Build Instructions

**Goal:**  
Provide a complete and developer-friendly README with clear setup steps and explanations of design choices.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] Includes environment setup instructions (Android Studio version, Gradle, API key configuration, etc.).
- [x] Explains project architecture and key design decisions (e.g., why MVVM, why Hilt).
- [x] Documents dependencies used (Retrofit, Coroutines, Coil, Hilt, etc.).
- [x] Provides instructions to build, run, and test the app locally.
- [x] Contains a brief overview of features, supported devices, and expected behavior.

---

## üß™ Bonus: Technical Excellence (Unit & UI Testing)

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate strong testing discipline using JUnit, MockK, or Compose UI testing frameworks.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] Unit tests validate repository, ViewModel, and domain logic.
- [x] MockK or Mockito is used to simulate network responses and verify API interactions.
- [x] UI tests (Compose/Espresso) verify the correct rendering of states and user flows.
- [x] All tests are automated and runnable via Gradle or Android Studio.
- [x] README explains why each test type was chosen and its contribution to app reliability.

## üìò Summary

The WeatherApp follows a **Clean, Expressive, and Focused** structure aligned with modern Android best practices.  
By leveraging **a single-screen design** with **Material 3 expressive theming**, the app achieves both simplicity and elegance ‚Äî allowing users to instantly view or search weather data without unnecessary navigation overhead.
